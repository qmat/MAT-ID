Keynote Essentials
1. Ensure new Keynote documents are packages not binary blobs
This means that instead of any change, nomatter how small, requiring a complete re-load of a monolithic binary file, instead the document is really a folder full of bits and bobs, and so version control can control the individual bits and bobs. Much better.
- Preferences > Tick "Save new documents as packages"
2. Ensure the right pixel size for print work
Long story short the best strategy with Keynote'09 is to put in 300dpi values for the slide's pixel size.

- Landscape: 3508 x 2480
